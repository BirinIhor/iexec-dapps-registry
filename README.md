# Docker With Script
## Description

Just illustrate how to use a custom script in your docker image on iExec.

To run this custom [Script](./apps/customScript.sh), we start on the ubuntu:trusty docker image and the script in it.

You can see the corresponding [Dockerfile](./apps/Dockerfile). This docker image has been pushed into this docker repository [iexechub/docker-with-script](https://hub.docker.com/r/iexechub/docker-with-script/).

## [Dapp params](./iexec.js)
