# R wordcloud
## Description
In the language of visual design, a tag cloud (or word cloud) is one kind of "weighted list", as commonly used on geographic maps to represent the relative size of cities in terms of relative typeface size. 
An early printed example of a weighted list of English keywords was the "subconscious files" in Douglas Coupland\'s Microserfs (1995). A German appearance occurred in 1992.

We use R program for generate this kind of wordcloud.

We have create a [R script](./apps/iExecWordcloud.R) to analyse the pdf content and generate a png image. 

To run this R Script, we start on the r-base docker image and we add wordcloud library and all needed dependencies to run our program.

You can see the corresponding [Dockerfile](./apps/Dockerfile). The docker image has been pushed into this docker repository [iexechub/r-wordcloud image](https://hub.docker.com/r/iexechub/r-wordcloud/).

## [Dapp params](./iexec.js)

The pdf url to analyse, the R script to launch and the docker image to use must be configure into the [iexec.js](./iexec.js).

##  Result
As an example, we give iExec Whitepaper pdf as input of the R Script : [iExec-WPv2.0-English.pdf](http://iex.ec/app/uploads/2017/04/iExec-WPv2.0-English.pdf).

You can see the wordcloud result of the iExec Whitepaper !!! It was generated by this [transaction](https://explorer.iex.ec/ropsten/tx/0xd18c6b9b1bea6438fa20b28ec4c80eb9044d82c9a4025c1cecc4410c3b37c2b2) on ropsten  ![iExecWordcloud.png](./apps/iExecWordcloud.png)
