  "description": "If you are tired of the random, cryptic addresses generated by regular bitcoin clients, you can use vanitygen to create a more personalized address. Vanitygen accepts as input a pattern, or list of patterns to search for, and produces a list of addresses and private keys. The search of Vanitygen is probabilistic, and the amount of time required to find a given pattern depends on how complex the pattern is, the speed of your computer, and whether you get lucky.",
